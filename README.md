# Soofaiap
Soofaiap is a prototype location-rating tool written in Javascript. It analyzes information about a city collected from a variety of freely-accessible APIs (Google Maps, Yelp, etc.) and then displays this information to users in the form of a heat map and weighted averages. For instance, the Google Food Data gives an indication of how many food businesses are in the area based on Google Maps data. Some metrics are weighted by metadata, such as the number and quality of reviews.
